# The Fundamentals - Why Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference?

## The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

> `“The aggregation of marginal gains”` is the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do.

### Why do small habits make a big difference?

> It is easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action.
> 

> If you can get 1% better each day for one year, you will end up 37 times better by the time you are done. Conversely, if you get 1% worse each day for one year, you will decline nearly down to zero.
> 

> Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.
> 

> The habits seem to make little difference on any given day, and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous.
> 

> Unfortunately, the slow pace of transformation also makes it easy to let a bad habit slide.
> 

> When we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results.
> 

> Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformation.
> 

> You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results.
> 

> Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits.
> 

> `**You get what you repeat.**`
> 

> Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally, Bad habits make time your enemy.

### What progress is really like?

> Breakthrough moments are often the results of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change.
> 

> Habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. In the early and middle stages of any quest, there is often a `Valley of Disappointment`.
> 

> “I have been running every day for a month, so why can’t I see any change in my body?” Once this kind of thinking takes over, it is easy to let good habits fall by the wayside. But in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau — what I call the `Plateau of Latent Potential`.
> 

> Change can take years before it happens all at once.
> 

> All big things come from small beginnings. The seed of every habit is a single, tiny decision. But as that decision is repeated, a habit sprouts and grows stronger.

### Forget about Goals; focus on System instead

> What is the difference between systems and goals? — Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.
> 

> Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress.
> 
- Problems arise when we spend too much time thinking about our goals.
    - Winners and losers have the same goals.
        - Goal setting suffers from a serious case of survivorship bias.
        - We concentrate on people who end up winning—the survivors—and mistakenly assume that ambitious goals led to their success while overlooking all of the people who had the same objective but didn’t succeed.
    - Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.
        - Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. That is the counterintuitive thing about improvement. We think we need to change our results, but the results are not the problem. What we really need to change are the systems that cause those results.
    - Goals restrict your happiness.
        - The implicit assumption behind any goal is this: `"Once I reach my goal, then I will be happy."` The problem with a `goals-first mentality` is that you are continuously putting happiness off until the next milestone.
        - Goals create an `either-or` conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful, or you fail, and you are a disappointment.
        - A `system-first mentality` provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running. And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just one you first envision.
    - Goals are at odds with long-term progress.
        - When all your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it?
        - The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game.

### A System of Atomic Habits

> If you are having trouble changing your habits, the problem is not you. The problem is your system. bad habits repeat themselves again and again, not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.
> 

> Focusing on the overall system, rather than a single goal, is one of the core themes of this book. It is also one of the deeper meanings behind the word `atomic`.
> 

> Atomic habits are not just any old habits, however small. They are little habits that are part of a larger system.
> 

> `atomic habits` — A regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do but also the source of incredible power, a component of the system of compound growth.
