# Should I be worried while changing jobs?

Desire to continuously improve:

Life is full of opportunities — each opportunity comes with a choice whether to grab the opportunity or not — each choice comes with fear and anxiety — fear of looking existing state — Anxiety of what ifs. 

Most of our choices also fall in one of these two categories:

- Stability — Should I choose less rewarding things that give a sense of comfort?
- Growth — Should I choose things that potentially give more reward but give a sense of risk?

What I recently realized is that there is nothing like right choices and wrong choices. Every individual, at a give time and in a given situation, makes the best choice possible based on the current level of understanding. 

That leads me to a point that it doesn’t matter whether I choose A or B — whether I choose stability or growth — whether I choose comfort or risk. What matters is my actions to back that choice. What are the things remains in my control, regardless of whether I choose A or B?

I realized that the answer to that question is my desire to improve. It is my desire to be better than what I am today. 

I might choose something and over the period of time realize that it is not unfolding as I was anticipating at the time while I made that choice. But even in this situation I will be happy and satisfied with the improvements I was able to make in myself over that period of time.
